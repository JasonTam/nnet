nnet
====

Simplified implementation of a neural network


Running the Program
===================

You can run the main program by running:

	main.m

You will then have to enter the paths to certain input and output files

Example Dataset
===============

I used the script `my_dataset.m` to preprocess data for the neural net. The raw data comes from the pattern recognition toolbox (PRT)[Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].
